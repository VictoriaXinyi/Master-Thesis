Bot or Not: A Comparison of Predictive Models for Twitter Bot Detection

This Thesis is for solving following problem:

Is is possible to construct a predictive model to classify bot accounts from human accounts?

If so, which predictive modelling approaches lead to the best results?

If so, which features prove to be most informative?

## Processed DATA

Level 1: User

Level 2: User + Tweets

Level 3: User + Network

Level 4: User + Tweets + Network

## Modelling
1. fast logistic regression model: caverlee.py

2. Logistic regression model, Decision Tree model and Random Forest Model for previous pocessed 4 levels of data: cresi modelling
